# Arduino projects

This repository aims to gather personal Arduino projects and a brief how-to guide to replicate them in the future or integrating them in other projects.

## Contents

Every Arduino project in this repository includes:

* Schematic file and image to replicate the circuit
* Code (could be a basic test)
* Markdown document with additional information (optional)

## External tools

### Schematics

Schematics are made with [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org) (it is an open source, free software multi-platform tool).
